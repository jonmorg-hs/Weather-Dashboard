# Weather-Dashboard
Homework Week 6

We were tasked with retrieving data from the Third-party API, Open Weather Map, using it in the context of our own. The challenge was to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

Using the homework image for reference for the web application's appearance and functionality.

I added a unit (metric or imperial) select option for the user's preference. The selection was stored and retrieved using local storage.

I also added functionality to confirm is the user would like to save the inputted city is the city is not already present in their favourites.

Right clicking a favorite city button when ask if the user would like the remove the city from their favorites.

If the city inputted doesnt return a valid response, the user is alerted that the inputted city doesnt exist and should enter again.

Also added was a 'Enter' keyboard stroke on the inputted city to search, thus not requiring to push the search button.
